## SPA online store (made with React class components using GraphQL)

Hello, stranger.

**What's this?**

This project is an implementation of a test assignment for Scandiweb. 

**How to make it work?**

To see the project in all its glory, you need to download and install it on your computer and run the data source in parallel. You can find information about how to run the data source at 
https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint

**Why?**

Some aspects of the implementation may not seem obvious, for this reason I think it is worth clarifying a couple of points:

1. Why did you reinvent the wheel instead of using the styled-components library? 

  Fair enough. I didn't want to load a cumbersome library and use it only in a couple of places. So I decided to implement the necessary logic myself. And it works!
(These weird things can be found in the Inputs)

2. Why Apollo and not Opus? 

  Easy. I used to work only with REST API, and Apollo has better documentation. If I had to implement something like this a second time, out of interest, I'd take Opus.
